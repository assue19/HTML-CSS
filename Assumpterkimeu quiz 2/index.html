One-piece gowns remained popular until the middle of the century. During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats were reduced in size.Lighter colors and lighter fabrics were also favored.In Colonial America, women most often wore a gown and petticoat, in which the skirt of the gown opened to reveal the petticoat underneath.Women also had riding habits which consisted of the petticoat, jacket and a waistcoat.


French fashion regarding dresses became very fast-changing during the later part of the 18th century.Throughout this period, the length of fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and floor-sweeping.Between 1740 and 1770, the robe à la française was very popular with upper-class women. In France, the Empire style became popular after the French Revolution. This style was more simple and was also favored by Josephine Bonaparte.
